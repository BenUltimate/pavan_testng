From pom.xml we have used for adding our dependencies 
in pom.xml we have two kind of entries we have 

dependencies -- download requred dependency jar for project 

plugines
--------
we can add plugins for pom.xml we can compile and run the project 

so in pom.xml we have two things dependencies and plugins 

once we added plugins we can compile and run the project 
so far we have run through xml file with in my eclipse but once you come out from eclipse 
some times we can run the test cases from outside of eclipse in that case we need to use pom.xml 

for this we have to add two plugins 

1)maven compiler plugin
This is used for compiling the code

 
2)maven surefire plugin 
This is used for running your project 

Both we need to add in pom.xml 

so now we have to run this through the pom.xml file 

once go to run as option now we have to run as a maven test 
==================================================================================================================================================================
so far we have executed our projects through pom.xml now if you do not have eclipse without having any ide 

for that we have to install maven softwrae 

maveen is having two levels 
one is within your eclipse 
we can also install maveen on operating system level 

once you comeout from maveen we have to install maveen from operating system level then we are able to run our entire project outside of command prompt 

Install maven system on operating system level 
----------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------
https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

download this from zip file and extract and keep it in some where here 

D:\apache-maven-3.9.9-bin\apache-maven-3.9.9\bin

Go to the environment variables and click on edit and paste this path 


Now go to the cmd prompt and change the location to our project location 

C:\Users\ADMIN\eclipse-workspace\OpencartV121

now type mvn test 


but i don't want to use manually 

simply we can create one bat file 


so we have seen within the eclipse and also outside of eclipse now 
as of now we have executed commands two commands we have executed in command prompt 
simply we can create create one bat file and execute 


Now it is executable file not text file "run.bat" when you click on save as it will change it to bat file 

So now with single click everything will be executed
