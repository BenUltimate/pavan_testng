1)Test case : Account Registration 
1.1: Create BasePage under "pageObjects" which includes only constructor. This will be invoked by every page object class 
constructor(Re-usability)
1.2 Create Page object Classes for HomePage,RegistrationPage under pageObjects package.
(These classes extends from BasePage)

1.3) Create AccountRegistrationTest under "testCases"
1.4)Create BaseClass under testBase package and copy re-usable methods 
1.5)Create re-usable methods to generate random numbers and strings in BaseClass.


2)Adding logs to test case(log4j2)
=================================
2.1 Add log4j2.xml file under src/test/resources
2.2 Update BaseClass
2.3 Add log statements to AccountRegistrationTest

Loggging -recording all the events in the form of text.

Nomrally There are two kinds of logs 

Application Logs
---------------
Any user performing action in the application backed side log files will be generated 
what ever the actions are done by the user or customer 
every event will be logged into the log file 
at the backend side as a user we cannot see 
in production any user is doing unauthorized action in that particular case 
they can easily track the information they can do the immediate action 
 
Automation Logs 
---------------
through the test case what ever the events are doing 
if any test case is failed then that information is also part of log file 

Log Levels

All<Trace <Debug <Info <Warn <Error <Fatal <Off


Appenders - where to generate logs (Console/File)
Loggers - what type of logs generate(All<Trace<Debug<Info<Warn<Error<Fatal<Off)

In log4j2.xml we have to specify where we have to store in console /File that we have to write down in log4j2.xml file 


In the base class we have to update the log file 

why base class bcz this is the common class required for every test case 


3)Run Test on Desired Browser /Cross Browser /Parallel
======================================================
3.1)create testng.xml file to run test cases and parameterize browser name and OS to BaseClass
setUp() method 
3.2)Update BaseClass->setUp() method launch browser based on conditions
3.3)maintain seperate xml to run test multiple browsers parallelly.
