Selenium Grid SetUp 
===================
In Grid mainly we have two components Grid Hub and Node 

what is a hub and Node ?

Hub 
---
from where you have written the test cases 
from where you are executing the test cases 
from where you are controlling the entire setUp that is called as Hub main system is called Hub 

Node
-----
it is nothing but remote machines 
on which browser on which os 

For example : mac-> linux-->windows these are different machines 

Node is nothing but a machine in which all browsers are installed 

Throught the grid we have to attach this information to the particular hub 
what ever the nodes are there all of them we have to attach to Hub 

so the hub is able to recognize all the nodes in the grid entire setUp is called as grid 



In real environment it is very difficult to put the physical machines 
very costly that also we will use them temporarly only for testing purpose we will use few days 

2nd option is vms it means virtual machines the operating system we can install it on our operating system 
Lets say windows is Main Host 
we can install vm's software and use it in windows
again this is also very problametic to create vms and install 

so we will go through the docker 
first we will download the image from dockor and we will create a container 
so this container can have all the setUp 

Now this container will make it as a Node 
we can download multiple images from docker hub 
from those images we can download multiple containers 
every container is acting as a node 


In single system also we can make it as Hub and Node it is also possible 

StandAlone :->for single system we can call it as a StandAlone Using Hub & Node 
Distributed:->for multiple systems we can call it as a Distributed Node -->this part we will use using docker concept 


StandAlone
----------
1.Download selenium-server-4.15.0.jar and place it somewhere 
2.Run below command to start selenium Grid 
	java -jar selenium-server-4.15.0.jar standalone
	3.Url to see sessions:http://localhost:4444/
	





Hub&Node setup(Multiple machines)
---------------------------------
1.Download selenium-server-4.15.0.jar and place it somewhere in both (hub & node) the machines
2.Run below command to make machine as hub 
	java-jar selenium-server-4.15.0.jar hub

3.Run below command to make machine as node
	java-jar selenium-server-4.15.0.jar node --hub http://<hub-ip>:4444
	
4.URL to see sessions:http://localhost:4444/
